For this lab, I collaborated with Carlos Dominguez to figure out how to
redirect the stdin and stdout file descriptors of the parent and child
processes to perform shell redirection and piping. I also used various sites
such as stackoverflow.com and youtube.com to better understand the technique
in performing redirection and piping.
